-The main() method in DFS.java is the driver for the program.
-The program initializes the graph with  5 vertices, 5 edges.

The user can call stronglyConnectedComponents(Graph g) on the graph:
	-Which will use the concept of Depth First Search to return the number of strongly connected components in given graph.
