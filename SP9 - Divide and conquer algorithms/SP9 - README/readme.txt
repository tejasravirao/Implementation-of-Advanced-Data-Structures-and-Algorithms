Implement and compare the running times of the following algorithms on randomly generated arrays:  
(a) Insertion sort,  (b) Merge sort (take 1), (c) Merge sort (take 2),  (d) Merge sort (take 3).


IDE used Intellij IDEA 2018.2.2
- Create a new Java project.
- Inside src folder, include the package txr171830.
- Change value of size (n = 1M, 2M, 4M, 8M...) accordingly 
  and set the value of "choice" variable to choose any 1 of the 4 algorithms.
- The choices are (1) Insertion Sort
                  (2) Merge Sort Take 1
                  (3) Merge Sort Take 2
                  (4) Merge Sort Take 3
- Run SP9.java
- All outputs observed have been recorded in the report file.


Please check attached file SP9_Report.pdf for all recorded observations.
