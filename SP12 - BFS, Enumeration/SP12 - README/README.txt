Implement the algorithm to find the diameter of a tree using the
algorithm discussed in class, that runs BFS twice.  Code this
algorithm without modifying Graph.java and BFSOO.java, using them
from package rbk.


IDE used Intellij IDEA 2018.2.2
- Create a new Java project.
- Inside src folder, include the package txr171830.
- SP12.java makes use of the Graph class and BFSOO class from package rbk.
- Run SP12.java
